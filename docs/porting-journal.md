# Porting journal

Dated log of findings from the EasyR1 → A3 port. Each entry is a single investigation or decision. Append-only (never retcon; if an entry turns out wrong, add a later entry that supersedes it, referencing the original).

---

## 2026-04-17 — initial dep-tree analysis

**Context:** no A3 hardware yet; working off the two `quay.io/ascend/verl` docker images plus source trees in `upstream/`.

### Images inspected

- `quay.io/ascend/verl:verl-8.5.0-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.11-latest` (14.1 GB) — CANN 8.5.0, torch 2.8.0, torch_npu 2.8.0, transformers 4.57.6, vllm_ascend 0.13.1.dev.
- `quay.io/ascend/verl:verl-8.5.2-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.11-qwen3-5` (24.2 GB) — CANN 8.5.1 (not 8.5.2 — that's the image revision), torch 2.9.0, torch_npu 2.9.0, transformers 5.3.0.dev0, vllm_ascend 0.17.0rc2.dev.

Both use Python 3.11.14 at `/usr/local/python3.11.14`, `triton_ascend 3.2.0`, ATB, and the same 3-script entrypoint that sources CANN/ATB env vars.

Full details in `repo/knowledge/images/verl-8.5.{0,2}-a3.md`.

### Source deps extracted

- **EasyR1 master**: 20 runtime deps in `requirements.txt`. No optional extras, no `requirements-npu.txt`, no test-deps file. (See `repo/knowledge/easyr1-master-deps.md`.)
- **veRL master**: core `requirements.txt` (25 packages) + `requirements-npu.txt` (21 packages) + `setup.py` extras (`gpu`, `vllm`, `sglang`, `test`, `geo`, etc.). The NPU file is the most useful reference. (See `repo/knowledge/verl-master-deps.md`.)

### Matrix built

`repo/docs/dep-matrix.md` — per-package rows covering EasyR1, veRL-core, veRL-NPU, both images. Main findings:

- **15 of EasyR1's 20 deps already ship in the A3 images** matching or exceeding EasyR1's pins.
- **3 real gaps**: `flash-attn` (NPU replacement), `liger-kernel` (drop or triton-ascend port), `pillow` (add to install list).
- **1 version gap tied to image choice**: EasyR1's `transformers>=4.54.0,<5.0.0` fits the 8.5.0 image (4.57.6) but not 8.5.2 (5.3.0.dev0).

### Decision: target 8.5.0 first

**Why:** EasyR1's transformers ceiling is compatible with 8.5.0 out of the box. This cuts the initial port to two concrete changes (flash-attn + liger-kernel) instead of also fighting a transformers 5.x migration.

**How this affects task ordering:** the 8.5.2 migration (torch_npu 2.9, vllm_ascend 0.17, transformers 5.x) becomes a follow-on task, not a v1 blocker.

### Gaps to turn into porting sub-tasks

1. **EasyR1-side shim — attention + kernels** (`upstream/EasyR1/ascend-port`): make `flash-attn` and `liger-kernel` imports optional, gate on device type, route attention through `torch_npu` / `vllm_ascend` backend. Size: small–medium, x86-doable at import level.
2. **EasyR1 dep manifest — pillow + tensordict pin** (`upstream/EasyR1/ascend-port`): add `pillow` explicitly; consider mirroring veRL's `tensordict>=0.8.0,<=0.10.0,!=0.9.0` pin so EasyR1 doesn't accidentally pull an incompatible version. Trivial.
3. **`huggingface_hub` 1.x API audit** (EasyR1 source scan): grep for `hf_hub_download`, `snapshot_download`, `HfApi` and confirm 1.x compatibility. If any deprecated call-site remains, patch it. Scan-only first, patch if needed.
4. **8.5.2 migration (deferred)**: transformers 4.x → 5.x compatibility in EasyR1. Separate task set; triggered after v1 works on 8.5.0.
5. **A3 runtime validation (BLOCKED — needs hardware)**: build image on top of 8.5.0 adding the EasyR1 ascend-port branch; rollout smoke test; short training run.

### Harness extracted from this session

Not yet formalized as skills. The recurring patterns we can lift once the workflow stabilizes:

- **Image inventory pipeline**: `docker create` → `docker cp site-packages` → derive pip-freeze from `.dist-info` → emit markdown knowledge doc. Candidate skill: `inspect-ascend-image` in `repo/skills/`.
- **Dep-set diff**: two pip-freeze-style lists → markdown matrix with classification column. Candidate skill/script: `scripts/dep-diff.py` + a skill that prompts the classification.
- **Gap-to-porting-task conversion**: given a gap row, draft the branch/commit plan. Candidate skill: `classify-dep-gap`.

Deferring skill authoring until we've done the pattern at least twice (once now; second pass will come when validating on A3 or when a new EasyR1 version arrives).

## 2026-04-17 (addendum) — codex review corrections

Ran a `codex exec` review against the design doc, dep-matrix, and this journal. The review surfaced corrections I'm landing immediately rather than leaving the earlier entry misleading.

### Factual error

- **pillow was NOT missing from the images.** Both 8.5.0 and 8.5.2 ship `pillow-12.2.0`. My original filter grep in `grep -E '^(torch|transformers|…)[_-]'` did not include `pillow`, so I assumed absent. Corrected in `dep-matrix.md`. "Three real gaps" → "two dep-level gaps (flash-attn, liger-kernel) + the 8.5.2-only transformers ceiling."

### Material omissions — dep-matrix was only half the story

Codex caught (and source-grep confirmed) that the actual port surface includes CUDA-specific **code paths** that no package swap will fix. Updated `dep-matrix.md` with a new §"Code-path blockers (NOT dependency gaps)" table enumerating ≈35 call sites across ~10 files:

- Distributed backend hardcoded `nccl` (`fsdp_workers.py:83`) — must become `hccl` on NPU.
- Device mesh + `device_map` hardcoded `"cuda"` (several sites in `fsdp_workers.py`).
- `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` hardcoded in `from_pretrained` calls + monkey-patched as the default in `models/monkey_patch.py:45`.
- `torch.cuda.*` calls pervasive across `workers/`, `utils/`, `protocol.py`, `checkpoint/`.
- Direct `from flash_attn ...` imports: kernel func + `bert_padding` helpers + triton cross-entropy — some of these (padding helpers) aren't attention kernels at all, they're pure-torch utilities that just happen to live in flash-attn's package.

### Hidden direct deps

EasyR1 imports `jinja2`, `psutil`, `pyyaml` in runtime code without declaring them in `requirements.txt`. Both A3 images happen to ship them, but that's fragile. Adding to the ascend-port branch's `requirements.txt`.

### Scope narrowing

Design doc §1.2 said "port EasyR1" broadly. Narrowed §1.4 to v1 = text-only PPO/GRPO on Qwen2/Qwen3, 8.5.0 base image, default loggers only. VLM/video, 8.5.2 migration, liger-kernel via triton-ascend, and deeper flash-attn perf work all go to v2+.

### Design-doc internal consistency fix

§4.4.1 (docker image build plan) previously said "on top of `verl-8.5.2-a3`" while §4.2 strategy says "target 8.5.0 first." Fixed to 8.5.0 throughout.

### Updated §4.2 task list

The earlier flat 3-task list (flash-attn optional, pillow, hf_hub audit) was replaced with a 9-task list grouped into dep-level (1 task) + code-path level (5 tasks) + deferred (3 tasks). See `design.md:4.2`.

### Meta — the review tool itself

- `codex exec` (gpt-5.4) works as a second-opinion reviewer on this box.
- Gotcha: the default `-s read-only` sandbox blocks local file reads on this host (bubblewrap `Failed RTM_NEWADDR`). Use `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for local doc reviews — safe here because the prompt is read-only and the reviewer has no write actions.
- First review run (sandboxed) produced partial but valid findings by inspecting upstream GitHub. Second run (bypass) produced grounded findings tied to our actual files. **Lesson: always verify codex could actually read the target before trusting its specifics.** When file reads fail silently, it falls back to searches and inference.
- Skill write-up: `repo/skills/codex-review/` (see task 8).

### Re-verdict

Ready for 4.2 (code changes on `ascend-port` branch) once the design-doc and dep-matrix edits above land. The dependency-tree analysis is now complete in both the pip-freeze sense and the code-path-surface sense.

---

## 2026-04-18 — 4.2.1 + 4.2.2 shipped on `upstream/EasyR1/ascend-port`

Branch now has 4 commits:

1. `7ee0f0b` — split `requirements.txt` into common / gpu / npu variants. Moved flash-attn / liger-kernel / vllm to `requirements-gpu.txt`. Declared hidden direct imports (`jinja2`, `psutil`, `pyyaml`). Tightened `tensordict` pin. `requirements-npu.txt` is a placeholder pointing at the verl-A3 base image.
2. `72b564a` — added `verl/utils/device.py` with `is_npu_available()`, `get_device_name()`, `get_device_module()`, `get_visible_devices_env()`, `get_dist_backend()`. Pure helper; no behavior change when `torch_npu` is absent.
3. `7187b51` — routed ~35 `torch.cuda.*` call sites across 10 files through the device-module accessor. Covers RNG, mem_get_info, empty_cache, current_device, max_memory_*, manual_seed, device-mesh device type, dist backend, device_map, ROCm detection (guarded on NPU). Also `torch.backends.cuda.matmul.*` knobs guarded behind `not is_npu_available()`.
4. `496d198` — fix-ups from codex review: wrap bare `current_device()` int in `torch.device(device_name, index)` for the `.to()` calls in `DataProto`/`TensorDict` (codex flagged bare int as fragile); fix missed `flat_param_to("cuda", ...)` in `load_fsdp_submodule`; add `extras_require["gpu"]` to `setup.py` so `pip install '.[gpu]'` restores the moved packages; make `load_rng_state` raise `KeyError` loudly when both `accelerator` and `cuda` keys are missing.

### Codex review lessons

- First review run was sandboxed and silently couldn't read local files (bwrap `Failed RTM_NEWADDR` on this host). Switched to `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` and got grounded review instead.
- Caught pillow misclassification (it ships in both images as 12.2.0; my original filter grep missed it). Corrected dep-matrix.
- Also caught that ≈35 CUDA-specific code paths exist that my pure dep analysis missed. This reframed task 4.2 around code-path work, not just dep work.
- Saved a `feedback` memory entry for the sandbox-bypass gotcha + verification discipline.

### Version-aware review discipline (added after user feedback)

User flagged that I was reviewing NPU upstreams against master. NPU projects ship production builds from version-specific branches (torch-npu `vX.Y.Z-SDK.M.N`, vllm-ascend `releases/vX.Y`, triton-ascend `release/X.Y.x`). Master diverges from the branches and misleads review.

Produced `repo/knowledge/upstream-refs.md` mapping each upstream to the ref matching each verl-A3 image:

- 8.5.0 image → torch-npu `v2.8.0-7.3.0`, transformers `v4.57.6`, vllm-ascend `releases/v0.13.0` (image uses post-branch dev build), triton-ascend `release/3.2.x`.
- 8.5.2 image → torch-npu `v2.9.0-7.3.0`, transformers `main`, vllm-ascend `main`, triton-ascend `release/3.2.x` (+ upstream triton `3.6.0`).

Updated `repo/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md` with a version-aware section and saved a second `feedback` memory.

### Re-verification of 4.2.2 against v2.8.0-7.3.0

Spot-checked torch-npu's `v2.8.0-7.3.0` branch for every API we route through `get_device_module()`:

- `empty_cache`, `mem_get_info`, `get_rng_state`, `set_rng_state`, `manual_seed`, `current_device`, `set_device`, `max_memory_allocated`, `max_memory_reserved` — all exist with signatures matching `torch.cuda` equivalents. `get_rng_state` / `set_rng_state` default device is "current NPU" so our no-arg usage is correct.
- `get_device_name(device=None)` — takes a device-index arg, validates it, then ignores it and calls `_npu_getDeviceName()` with no index (returns current device). Same quirk codex flagged on master; not a regression, not fixed on this branch. Our `flops_counter.py` calls it with no args so we're safe, but any future site that tries to query a non-current device by index would need `torch.npu.get_device_properties(i).name` instead.
- `torch_npu.__init__.py:203-205` registers "npu" as a PrivateUse1 backend + device module. That's what makes `torch.npu`, `torch.device("npu", i)`, and `init_device_mesh("npu", ...)` all work after `import torch_npu`.
- `torch_npu.__init__.py:258` registers "hccl" as a torch.distributed backend. That's what makes `init_process_group(backend="hccl")` work.
- `torch_npu.contrib.transfer_to_npu` exposes a monkey-patch that rewrites CUDA calls → NPU at runtime. We explicitly do **not** rely on it; our approach (explicit device-name routing) is more robust for code review and doesn't require users to opt into the contrib shim.

**Verdict**: the 4.2.1 + 4.2.2 work is valid on the 8.5.0 target. Moving to 4.2.5 (attention backend dispatch) + 4.2.6 (vendor flash-attn padding helpers).

---

## 2026-04-18 — 4.2.5 + 4.2.6 shipped

Branch now 7 commits (the user sign-off delivery point for the x86-doable phase):

5. `6701a50` — attention backend NPU-aware. New `get_default_attn_implementation()` in `verl/utils/device.py` (sdpa on NPU, flash_attention_2 on CUDA). Made `ModelConfig.attn_implementation` optional — resolves at runtime if None. Threaded through the two `AutoClass.from_pretrained` / `from_config` calls in `fsdp_workers.py`. Made `apply_ulysses_patch` raise on NPU (codex later caught that the error text blamed the wrong thing).
6. `da2487f` — decoupled padding helpers from flash-attn. Added `verl/utils/npu_flash_attn_utils.py` (pure-torch reimpl of index_first_axis / pad_input / unpad_input, lifted from flash-attn bert_padding.py per veRL's own NPU port). Added `verl/utils/attention_utils.py` façade — lazy dispatch between flash_attn.bert_padding (CUDA) and the vendored copy (NPU). Updated `dp_actor.py` and `dp_critic.py` to import from the façade.
7. `ffafa0d` — corrective pass from codex review. Moved the NPU `padding_free=True` rejection from `apply_ulysses_patch` to `_build_model_optimizer` in `fsdp_workers.py` (config-level, with clearer error text). Kept `apply_ulysses_patch`'s NPU branch as a defensive backstop. Added `tests/test_device.py` — first x86 unit tests in the port — mocking `is_npu_available()` to verify every accessor's cuda/npu resolution.

### Key decisions / rationale

- **SDPA on NPU, not `npu_fusion_attention`**: on transformers 4.57.6 + torch_npu v2.8.0-7.3.0, SDPA dispatches to NPU kernels and the Qwen2/Qwen3 families ship `_supports_sdpa = True`. Codex verified the SDPA path even has explicit NPU handling (mask conversion, GQA disabling). `npu_fusion_attention` would give better perf but the signature is substantially different from flash-attn's (string `input_layout`, `actual_seq_qlen` lists, not `cu_seqlens` tensors). Porting `_custom_flash_attention_forward` to it is a v2 task.
- **Padding-free is NPU-blocked in v1**: SDPA doesn't handle the unpadded/flattened token path that `flash_attn_varlen_func` does. Wiring NPU varlen would require writing an equivalent forward on top of `npu_fusion_attention`. Out of v1.
- **Ulysses SP is NPU-blocked in v1**: same reason; the ulysses-SP forward at `flash_attention_utils.py` calls `flash_attn_varlen_func` directly.
- **Vendored `bert_padding` helpers in v1 even though padding-free is blocked**: cheap to land (the helpers are pure torch), removes the try/except ImportError guards from `dp_actor.py` / `dp_critic.py`, and unblocks a future NPU padding-free implementation without further churn.
- **Triton cross-entropy fallback (`FLAH_ATTN_CROSS_ENTROPY_LOSS_AVAILABLE`)** already exists in `torch_functional.py`. On NPU, flash-attn is absent → flag is False → `F.cross_entropy(logits.float(), labels)` is used. The fp32 upcast is slightly slower than the flash-attn triton CE kernel but correct. Codex flagged this as a known CUDA-specific assumption still in the audit list; adequate for v1.

### Codex review lessons (second pass)

- With version-aware refs in the prompt, codex read `upstream/torch-npu` at `v2.8.0-7.3.0` and `upstream/transformers` at `v4.57.6`. Findings were tied to those refs, not master. Skill update worked as intended.
- Caught a real messaging bug: my NPU gate in `apply_ulysses_patch` blamed ulysses when the real issue was padding_free. Moving the check upstream to the config-level validation made the error traceable.
- Suggested x86 unit tests — first ones in the port. Easy win, improves regression safety without hardware.

### Remaining v2 audit items (for post-v1)

- Replace `F.cross_entropy` upcast with an NPU-optimized CE kernel (triton-ascend?).
- Write NPU varlen attention forward on top of `npu_fusion_attention` so padding_free=True works on NPU.
- Write NPU-aware ulysses SP forward.
- Consider 8.5.2 migration (torch_npu 2.9 / transformers 5.x).

### Status summary

Phase 4.2 code changes (2.1–2.6) are complete on `ascend-port`. 7 commits, +339/-63. Everything AST-parses. Device tests pass locally (under stubbed torch). Moving to phase 4.4 (build a Dockerfile layered on verl-8.5.0-a3 + install EasyR1 ascend-port) — which is **as far as x86 can take us**. Then the rest is BLOCKED on A3 hardware: rollout smoke test, short training run, runtime validation.

---

## 2026-04-18 — 4.4.1 image built

`upstream/EasyR1/Dockerfile.npu` takes `verl-8.5.0-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.11-latest` as the base and lays EasyR1 `ascend-port` on top with just the common `requirements.txt` and an editable install. Built cleanly on this x86 box (image tag: `easyr1-npu:ascend-port`).

### Build output observations (dep-matrix validation)

Every common-requirements pin came back as "Requirement already satisfied." That confirms the dep-matrix analysis: the 20 declared EasyR1 runtime deps plus the 3 hidden imports (jinja2/psutil/pyyaml) are fully covered by the base image. Zero downloads during the install step.

Small gotcha: the base image already installs veRL as `verl`. EasyR1 also installs as `verl` (same Python package name; EasyR1 is a veRL fork). The editable install overlays EasyR1's `/opt/easyr1/verl` via a `.pth` file so `import verl` now resolves to EasyR1's code. The veRL `.dist-info` lingers harmlessly. Expected, no action.

### CPU-level smoke tests inside the image

Ran three kinds of smoke test inside the image on this x86 host, with `TORCH_DEVICE_BACKEND_AUTOLOAD=0` to bypass the torch_npu autoload (which fails here because `libascend_hal.so` is NPU-only):

1. **Default accessors** — `verl.utils.device` imports and returns `cuda` / `flash_attention_2` / `nccl` / `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`. Would flip to the NPU variants on A3.
2. **attention_utils façade** — `index_first_axis`, `pad_input`, `unpad_input`, `rearrange` import via the façade without triggering flash_attn or torch_npu. Consumers (dp_actor, dp_critic) get clean imports.
3. **Vendored NPU padding-helpers correctness** — ran a real round-trip: `unpad_input(hidden, attention_mask)` then `pad_input(unpadded, indices, batch, seqlen)` on a small tensor with a sample attention mask. Output shape `(2, 4, 3)`, non-masked positions match the original input. The vendored implementation is correct at the tensor level (the same torch ops run on NPU via torch_npu).

### A3-gated work remaining

- **4.4.2** [BLOCKED] Rollout-only smoke test: one EasyR1 recipe, rollout path only on A3. Needs the image running on NPU hardware with HCCL collectives and `vllm_ascend` engine.
- **4.4.3** [BLOCKED] End-to-end short training run (few steps) on a small Qwen2/Qwen3 model with `padding_free=False`, `ulysses_size=1` (v1 scope).
- **4.4.4** [BLOCKED] Document runtime findings. Any recurring issue that surfaces there feeds back into the harness (new skill or script).

### Phase 4.3 harness buildout — where we are

Not formally authored as a "skill" beyond `codex-review`, but the following knowledge artifacts have accumulated and are reusable:

- `repo/docs/dep-matrix.md` template — per-package rows with gap classification. Reusable for any future version bump or adjacent RL stack port.
- `repo/knowledge/images/verl-8.5.{0,2}-a3.md` — the image inventory pattern.
- `repo/knowledge/upstream-refs.md` — version-aware refs pattern. Explicitly generalizable.
- `repo/knowledge/{easyr1,verl}-master-deps.md` — source-dep extraction pattern.
- `repo/skills/codex-review/SKILL.md` — reusable across any review-type task; the big win.

Skills that would need explicit authoring if we wanted to formalize further:
- `inspect-ascend-image` — given an image, produce the pip freeze + site-packages knowledge doc.
- `diff-dep-sets` — matrix generation from two dep sets.
- `classify-dep-gap` — automate the V/P/R/A/D classification.

None are urgent. They'd earn their place by being useful for the next EasyR1 version bump or the first adjacent-stack port. Flagged in design.md as TODO.

### Session stopping point

As far as x86 can take us. Next user-facing decision: provision A3 hardware and run 4.4.2 / 4.4.3. Until then, this branch is ready.

---

## 2026-04-18 (eve) — A3 host onboarded + first NPU smoke

Host details now in memory (`a3_server.md`) and `repo/` has been copied from our x86 box to `github.com/zhshgmail/easyr1-npu` (private). EasyR1 ascend-port is on `github.com/zhshgmail/EasyR1` (private fork, added as `personal` remote locally), 8 commits replicated. Standard dirs `/home/z00637938/workspace`, `/data/z00637938`, `/tmp/z00637938` created on A3. `repo/scripts/run-npu-container.sh` is the canonical container runner — device passthrough + the three user-scoped bind mounts + `network=host --ipc=host` for HCCL.

### First real NPU issue: broken triton-ascend install in the base image

`verl-8.5.0-a3-ubuntu22.04-py3.11-latest`'s `triton-ascend 3.2.0` install is partial. The dist-info RECORD file lists `triton/__init__.py` (1347 bytes) and many sibling files, but the filesystem only contains the compiled subdirs (`_C`, `backends`, `language`, `runtime`, `tools`, `triton_patch`). No `__init__.py` means `import triton` gives an empty namespace, and `torch._inductor.runtime.triton_compat` — which `import torch_npu` transitively pulls in — fails with `ImportError: cannot import name 'Config' from 'triton'`.

Reproduction (inside base image):
```
python3 -c "import torch; import torch_npu"
# ImportError: cannot import name 'Config' from 'triton' (unknown location)
```

Confirmed the same error in the adjacent `verl-sglang-8.3.rc1-a3` image someone else had running — so this is a base-image-build issue, not specific to our layer.

Hint from `/vllm-ascend/Dockerfile.a3.openEuler` (inside the base image):
```
# In x86, triton will be installed by vllm. But in Ascend, triton doesn't work correctly. we need to uninstall it.
RUN ... && python3 -m pip uninstall -y triton && python3 -m pip cache purge
```
So the build sequence leaves a partial triton tree on disk when vllm is installed first, then triton uninstalled, then triton-ascend reinstalled — and the reinstall somehow didn't populate the top-level files back. A known-bad ordering in the base image build script.

Fix in our `Dockerfile.npu`: force-reinstall triton-ascend immediately after `FROM`, before anything else. One extra RUN layer, ~1.6 GB delta.

```dockerfile
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall --no-deps triton-ascend==3.2.0 || \
    pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall --no-deps \
      --index-url https://mirrors.huaweicloud.com/ascend/repos/pypi triton-ascend==3.2.0
```

Falls back to huaweicloud's Ascend PyPI mirror if PyPI direct fails (it will on some days — pypi.org is TIMEOUT from this host today, though aliyun is configured as the default index).

### V1.1 / V1.2 smoke PASSED

After the triton-ascend repair, inside the rebuilt container (chips 0,1 passed through):

```
torch.__version__: 2.8.0+cpu
torch_npu.__version__: 2.8.0
torch.npu.is_available(): True
torch.npu.device_count(): 2
---
is_npu_available(): True
get_device_name(): npu
get_device_module(): <module 'torch_npu.npu' …>
get_default_attn_implementation(): sdpa
get_dist_backend(): hccl
get_visible_devices_env(): ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES
---
round-trip result (3x4 tensor, x*2+1 on NPU): correct values back
unpad shapes: torch.Size([5, 3]) torch.Size([5]) torch.Size([3]) 3
pad/unpad round-trip on npu: OK
```

All accessors resolve to their NPU variants. The vendored `npu_flash_attn_utils.py` helpers run correctly against `torch_npu` — first hardware validation of that file beyond x86 CPU.

### Next: V1.3 rollout smoke

Need to download a small Qwen2 checkpoint (Qwen2-0.5B) via `hf-mirror.com` into `/data/z00637938/models/`, then run a rollout through `vllm_ascend` inside the container. This is the first real test of the vllm_ascend attention path on this image.

### V1.3 rollout smoke PASSED

Downloaded `Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct` via hf-mirror.com (no `hf_transfer` since the host python doesn't have it, plain HTTPS is fine — 954 MB in ~2 minutes, one file at 1:58 per-file spike but overall fine) to `/data/z00637938/models/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct`.

`repo/scripts/smoke_v13_rollout.py` loaded the model through vllm 0.13.0 + vllm_ascend 0.13.1.dev18, TP=1, `enforce_eager=True`, `gpu_memory_utilization=0.5`. Key log lines:

- `device_config=npu`, `backend=hccl` (confirms our device + collective routing)
- `Loading model weights took 0.9348 GB`
- `Available memory: 30891205120, total memory: 65787658240` (half the chip)
- `GPU KV cache size: 2,513,920 tokens` (naming still says "GPU" — cosmetic, it's NPU)
- `init engine took 16.39 seconds`
- Three prompts generated coherent text: "Hello, my name is Daniel…", "The capital of France is Paris…", a working `fibonacci` snippet.
- Throughput `42.57 toks/s` single-chip bf16 eager — not optimized but enough to know the forward path works.

One harmless warning near the end (`Driver Version: 8��... is invalid or not supported yet`) and a teardown-time `Engine core proc died unexpectedly` — both cosmetic on clean runs (vllm engine shutdown race). Nothing actionable.

**Meaning for the port**: vllm_ascend 0.13.1.dev18 covers Qwen2 forward on this image. Our ascend-port changes don't touch the rollout path (it's vllm_ascend's own code), so we didn't regress anything there. Next is the harder test — V1.4 FSDP training, which does exercise our edits.

### Next: V1.4 training smoke

Requires wiring an EasyR1 trainer config with `padding_free=False`, `ulysses_size=1`, the local Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct path, a tiny dataset, a trivial reward. Then 2-4 GRPO steps.

---

## 2026-04-18 (late) — V1.4 bring-up bugs

Wrote `examples/qwen2_0_5b_math_grpo_npu_smoke.sh` (tiny batch, `padding_free=false`, `ulysses_size=1`, `max_steps=2`). Launched via `repo/scripts/run-npu-container.sh`. Each attempt uncovered one more NPU-specific issue, fixed on the local workstation and git-synced. Cumulative NPU-findings ledger:

### NPU-BUG-001: base image's triton-ascend install is partial

`verl-8.5.0-a3` ships `triton-ascend 3.2.0` but the filesystem under `/usr/local/python3.11.14/.../site-packages/triton/` is missing `__init__.py` and several top-level files that its own dist-info `RECORD` claims should be there. `import torch_npu` fails via `torch._inductor.runtime.triton_compat` (which wants `from triton import Config`).

**Fix**: `Dockerfile.npu` adds a `pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps triton-ascend==3.2.0` layer before any other installs. Falls back to huaweicloud Ascend PyPI mirror if PyPI is unreachable.

### NPU-CP-002: EasyR1 imports a vllm module that was renamed in vllm 0.13

`verl/utils/vllm_utils.py` does `from vllm.lora.models import LoRAModel`. vllm 0.13 (what our target image ships) renamed that file to `vllm.lora.lora_model`. Every `verl.trainer.main` import path transitively pulls vllm_utils in, so the module-level import breaks the whole trainer before anything runs.

**Fix**: try new-path first, fall back to old-path. Also moved `worker_manager` and `utils` imports into `hijack()` so module load doesn't force eager attribute lookups.

### NPU-CP-003: Ray doesn't auto-detect Ascend NPU as a builtin resource

Ray auto-detects CUDA GPUs as the sugar-named `"GPU"` resource. Ascend chips don't get that sugar. EasyR1's placement-group code requests `{"GPU": 1}` bundles and calls `ray.available_resources().get("GPU", 0)` → 0 → `ValueError: Total available GPUs 0 is less than total desired GPUs 2`.

**Fix across 4 files**:
- New `verl/utils/device.py::get_ray_resource_name()` returns `"NPU"` on NPU, `"GPU"` otherwise.
- `verl/trainer/main.py` passes `resources={"NPU": torch.npu.device_count()}` to `ray.init()` on NPU hosts.
- `verl/trainer/ray_trainer.py::_check_resource_available` reads `available_resources()[resource_name]`.
- `verl/single_controller/ray/base.py`: placement-group bundles use `{resource_name: 1}`; actor spawn uses `options["resources"]={"NPU": n}` (Ray's `num_gpus` sugar is CUDA-only).

### NPU-ENV-001: container didn't have HF_ENDPOINT

Dataset download (`hiyouga/math12k`) went to `huggingface.co` (blocked) → 5 retries → failure.

**Fix**: `run-npu-container.sh` injects `HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com` and `HF_HOME=/data/z00637938/hf-cache` by default.

### NPU-BUG-002: Ray 2.55 clears visibility env vars inside actors

Most confusing one. After the previous 3 fixes, Runner actor still failed with the pre-fix error message ("Total available GPUs 0"). Probed with a fresh Ray actor that imports `torch` + `torch_npu`: **driver saw `torch.npu.is_available() == True, device_count == 2`, actor saw `False, 0` and `ASCEND_RT_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""`**.

Ray 2.55+ defensively clears `{CUDA,ASCEND_RT,HABANA,NEURON_RT}_VISIBLE_*` env vars on actor spawn when the actor isn't claiming `num_gpus > 0`. Our Runner actor uses the custom `NPU` resource, not `num_gpus`, so Ray wipes the visibility list. `torch_npu` auto-load inside the actor then reports no NPU → `is_npu_available()` returns False → we hit the CUDA-path error message.

Ray itself surfaces the knob and warns: *"To enable this behavior and turn off this error message, set `RAY_ACCEL_ENV_VAR_OVERRIDE_ON_ZERO=0`"*.

**Fix**: `verl/trainer/main.py` adds `RAY_ACCEL_ENV_VAR_OVERRIDE_ON_ZERO=0` to `runtime_env.env_vars`.

### Non-bug but operational issue: build-time COPY shadowed our edits

`Dockerfile.npu` does `COPY . /opt/easyr1` + `pip install -e .`. The editable link points at the COPY, not the bind-mounted source. So every `git pull` on the host had to be followed by a `docker build` to take effect — a slow loop that masked whether our code changes were even applied. Spent ~5 reruns re-hitting the pre-fix error message until I noticed.

**Fix**: `run-npu-container.sh` now bind-mounts `/home/z00637938/workspace/easyr1-npu/upstream/EasyR1` over `/opt/easyr1`, so `git pull` is enough (no rebuild) for pure source changes. Dockerfile changes still need a rebuild.

**Lesson added to the `upstream-branch-hygiene` skill**: when an editable install's target path is baked into the image, the bind-mount has to shadow it.

### Also cleared `/opt/easyr1`'s stale `__pycache__`

After changing imports in edited modules while `.pyc` files existed, Python sometimes picked up the stale cache. `find .../upstream/EasyR1 -name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} +` once — and for future sessions, the runner script should probably clear caches on startup or set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`.

### V1.4 PASSED — GRPO 2 steps end-to-end on A3

Final bug before pass: `NPU-ENV-002` — vllm-ascend's FRACTAL_NZ layout causes param-sync precision drift in RL. Set `VLLM_ASCEND_ENABLE_NZ=0` in `ray.init` runtime_env. vllm-ascend itself raises a prescriptive `ValueError` pointing at exactly this knob.

After that commit (`cc8e794`), V1.4 completed:

- 2/2 training steps finished in 8m24s (Qwen2-0.5B, chips 0+1, bf16, eager, `padding_free=false`, `n=2` rollouts, `global_batch_size=4`)
- Actor forward+backward OK (entropy_loss printed: 0.991 → 1.263)
- Rollout generated coherent text via `vllm_ascend`
- Validation ran; `reward_score=0.016` (small model, 2 steps — expected)
- FSDP world_size=2 across two chips with HCCL — both ranks wrote `/tmp/z00637938/easyr1_smoke_ckpt/global_step_2/actor/{model,optim,extra_state}_world_size_2_rank_{0,1}.pt`
- vllm offload path exercised: `After vllm offload in sharding manager: 4.98 GB / 61.27 GB`

This is the v1 functional milestone per `design.md §1.1-1.4`. Everything from this point is either V1.5 (multi-card scale-up, same code), perf work, or the deferred v2 items (NPU varlen attention, ulysses, 8.5.2 migration).

### Summary of NPU-specific findings from the V1.4 bring-up

7 items total, all captured with stable IDs in `repo/knowledge/npu-patterns.md`:

- Code patterns (`NPU-CP-*`): 4 found
- Platform bugs (`NPU-BUG-*`): 2 found
- Env/config (`NPU-ENV-*`): 2 found
- Operational (`NPU-OPS-*`): 2 found (bind-mount shadowing, stale pycache)

Branch: 12 commits on `personal/ascend-port`. Source-of-truth for port: `zhshgmail/easyr1-npu` main (private).

## 2026-04-18 — V1.5 PASSED (multi-card scale-up)

Added `examples/qwen2_0_5b_math_grpo_npu_smoke_4chip.sh` — same config as V1.4 but `n_gpus_per_node=4`, `global_batch_size=8`, `rollout_batch_size=8`. Launched via `run-npu-container.sh --chips 0,1,2,3`.

Result: **2/2 training steps in 4m55s**. V1.4 on 2 chips was 8m24s — **1.7× wall-clock speedup** with 4 chips (sub-linear because per-step work is small and init overhead dominates). Same `entropy_loss` trajectory shape as V1.4 (different values are expected — different batches, different RNG across 4 vs 2 ranks). FSDP `world_size=4` across 2 A3 cards; HCCL inter-card collective path exercised for the first time. All 4 ranks wrote `/tmp/z00637938/easyr1_smoke_ckpt_4chip/global_step_2/actor/{model,optim,extra_state}_world_size_4_rank_{0,1,2,3}.pt`.

No new NPU-specific issues surfaced at 4-chip scale. The code paths (FSDP shard count, HCCL topology, vllm_ascend TP=1) were already exercised in V1.4; V1.5 just confirmed they scale.

## 2026-04-18 — harness fixes from second codex review

Second codex review flagged the catalog and skill implementation as not-yet-handoff-quality. Applied:

- `scripts/code-path-sweep.sh`: replaced broken `IFS='|' read` parser with parallel bash arrays. Canonicalized emitted IDs to match `npu-patterns.md` — no more invented `NPU-CP-001a/b/c` ad-hoc sub-IDs.
- `knowledge/npu-patterns.md`: rewritten with uniform `Symptom / Root cause / Fix / Commit ref / Generalizable rule` schema for every entry. Extended NPU-CP-001 to the full CUDA-API family. Promoted 4 latent risks to stable IDs: NPU-CP-005 (flash_attn/liger import), NPU-CP-006 (torch.backends.cuda knobs), NPU-ENV-003 (HCCL determinism), NPU-ENV-004 (RNG portability), NPU-OPS-003 (shared-host contention), NPU-OPS-004 (disk pressure). **Total: 16 IDs** across CP/BUG/ENV/OPS.
- `docs/skills-design.md`: status table (planned/shipped/deferred/superseded) so the 10-vs-6 mismatch is no longer a gap. Registered `ray-npu-shim` as an emergent unplanned shipment. Struck the "stable IDs TODO" note — DONE.
- `skills/ray-npu-shim/ray_npu_shim.py`: `apply_actor_options()` now pops any preexisting `num_gpus` on the NPU path, so upstream frameworks that default to `num_gpus=1` don't cause Ray to look for a mixed CUDA+NPU claim.
- `skills/ray-npu-shim/SKILL.md`: clarified that the shim is necessary-but-not-sufficient. A real second port also needs the `NPU-CP-001` sweep over the framework's own CUDA-named calls.

Harness handoff is now credible per the reviewer's verdict.

## 2026-04-20 — P1 scenario automation + attempted A3 regression (blocked on host state)

**Day's outcome**: P1 scenario (no-NPU-adaptation-needed) is **structurally** closed but **not empirically** validated; A3 host-state issue blocked the smoke regression.

### Done

- **`docs/DOCS-CONVENTION.md`** — documented convention file for doc organization; ends the "replan per session" cycle. README is index-only; HANDOVER is transit; DOCS-CONVENTION is stable rules. README 2-hop reachability to all important docs enforced.
- **`docs/easyr1-dep-chain-audit.md`** — systematic A/B/C/D/E classification of EasyR1 master's 20 runtime deps against v1 (8.5.0) image. **D = 0**. Proves P1 scenario is structurally closed (no new NPU development required).
- **`docs/npu-adaptation-tasks.md`** — tier-1/2/3 adaptation task registry, the single source of truth for "NPU gap" tracking.
- **`scripts/dep-gap-detect.sh` + `skills/dep-gap-detect/`** — automated A/B/C/D/E classifier. Takes requirements.txt + image inventory; exit 0 = P1 (proceed), exit 1 = P2 (stop + file task). Tested positive + negative cases pass.
- **`knowledge/npu-patterns.md` NPU-OPS-009** — new stable ID. Initial framing as "host driver state class" was too vague; see specific root cause below + refined NPU-OPS-009 entry.

### Attempted + blocked

- **V1.4 regression** of `ascend-port` head `ecce71d` on v1 (8.5.0) image — was supposed to verify the two drill cherry-picks don't regress v1. Failed at Ray resource check: `Total available GPUs 0`. Root-caused via vanilla-container isolation + `dmesg` to **UDA user-namespace conflict** (`uda_occupy_dev_by_ns ... Conflict open udevid`), not a driver bug and not a port regression. **Specific culprit**: zombie Ray raylet (PID 3546648, another user's `chj_roll` conda env, 1d16h old, Ray session dir `/tmp/ray/session_2026-04-18_*` already gone) holds NPU UDA lock exclusively via `--static_resource_list NPU,16`. User decided not to kill another user's process; wait for A3 recovery 2026-04-21+. One-command rerun lives in HANDOVER §6.2.

### Scope re-correction (earlier in day)

- "Modify NPU upstream libraries" / "modify CANN kernels" incorrectly labeled as out-of-scope. Corrected to 3-tier responsibility model: tier 1 (this repo), tier 2 (delegate to sister projects like `ascend-fused-accuracy-probe` / `a5_ops` / A3 kernel repo), tier 3 (escalate to Ascend team). All 4 docs (README / SKILLS-GUIDE / skills-design / PORT-GUIDE) updated consistently.

### Still open

- **T3-003** (A3 host NPU driver) — blocking T1-001 (V1.4 regression on 8.5.0) + T1-002 (V1.4 on 8.5.2). External dependency.
- **T1-003** automated dep-gap integrated with `image-upgrade-drill` as Step 1.5 — done, but the drill skill's discovery behavior still untested on a truly unknown break (dry-run 2026-04-19 leaked the answer).
- Task #29 (scope P2 end-to-end workflow) — next up once A3 unblocked.

Skill count: **8** (added `dep-gap-detect`). Catalog: **24 stable IDs** (added NPU-OPS-009).

## 2026-04-21 — P1 scenario empirically closed on 8.5.0; NPU-OPS-009 root cause corrected

**Day outcome**: V1.4 regression on `ascend-port` HEAD `ecce71d` against v1 (8.5.0) image **PASS with exact match to baseline** (entropy_loss step1=0.991, step2=1.263). The "理论 backward-compat" claim from yesterday is now **empirical backward-compat**. P1 closure goes from structural (D=0 per dep audit) to end-to-end validated.

Along the way, found that NPU-OPS-009 root cause was misdiagnosed yesterday — the fix is **on our side**, not "zombie Ray raylet holding UDA ns lock". See the ID's updated "Historical note" block for the honest account.

### Timeline

1. **A3 recovery attempt** — tried to diagnose "container can't see NPU while host can". dmesg showed `uda_occupy_dev_by_ns Conflict open udevid`, read it as Ascend driver / ns-refcount leak. Ran `device_hot_reset.sh` on a healthy host to "fix" the hypothetical leak → rmmod succeeded but PCI re-enumeration stuck → required full host reboot.
2. **After reboot + port 443 NAT re-established**: NPU back up. But our container still failed (same error). "Fix" didn't fix anything because diagnosis was wrong.
3. **Correct diagnosis**: `docker inspect` a sibling container (`roll_npu_new`) that was working fine on the same host today. Three bind-mount differences vs ours stood out: `/usr/local/dcmi`, narrowed `/usr/local/Ascend/driver/lib64` instead of whole tree, and `/etc/ascend_install.info`. Applied them → container `torch_npu.npu.device_count() = 2` immediately.
4. **Fix shipped in `b3f7a0f`**. Scp'd to A3 (A3 is firewalled, direct `git pull` from github times out). Relaunched smoke, hit second issue: `$USER=root` under ssh meant `run-npu-container.sh` defaulted `NPU_USER=root`, didn't bind `/data/z00637938`, so container couldn't find the Qwen2-0.5B model at the expected path. HF validator rejected the path. Added `--user z00637938` explicit flag and relaunched.
5. **V1.4 smoke PASS**: step1 entropy_loss=0.991 exactly, step2=1.263 exactly. Validation + checkpoint all clean.
6. **`run-npu-container.sh` still has a UX bug** (defaulting NPU_USER to $USER means ssh-as-root gives wrong data/home binds). Follow-up to either detect this or require `--user` for owners-other-than-current-shell-user. Not critical tonight.

### NPU-OPS-009 correction

The stable ID was first added 2026-04-20 with root cause "zombie Ray raylet UDA ns leak". That was wrong. Correction shipped in this session with a dated "Historical note" block keeping the misdiagnosis record so future readers see the anti-pattern explicitly ("dmesg line X therefore X is root cause" is seductive but often wrong for Ascend NPU; diff a working sibling container's run args first).

### Took away from today

1. **Sibling-container diff is the best first step for NPU container issues.** Not dmesg, not strace, not driver hacking. `docker inspect <working>` vs `docker inspect <broken>` finds config mismatches in 30 seconds.
2. **Do not run `device_hot_reset.sh` on a healthy host** to fix a hypothetical driver issue. It can wedge PCI enumeration and force a reboot. We did this yesterday and paid the cost of a full reboot + subsequent NAT-gateway-re-establishment wait.
3. **Port 443 on A3 is NAT'd from outside** — see today's Discord conversation + new HANDOVER §2.x entry. Not a host-side sshd config, not something we can change. Re-establishes a few minutes after host reboot.

### Still open

- **#27** (V1.4 on 8.5.2 drill image) — second smoke launched at 04:08 UTC, chips 0,1 (chips 2,3 inexplicably failed on the drill image; chips 0,1 worked for v1 smoke). Monitoring.
- **#28** propagate "empirical PASS" language to PORT-GUIDE / UPGRADE-DRILL-STATUS / HANDOVER §6.2 — pending #27 outcome.
- **#29** P2 end-to-end scenario design — next after #27/#28.

Skill count: **8** (unchanged). Catalog: **24 stable IDs** (NPU-OPS-009 rewritten, not re-numbered).

## 2026-04-22 — P1 empirically closed on BOTH 8.5.0 and 8.5.2 images

**Day outcome**: full P1 end-to-end closure. `ascend-port` HEAD `ecce71d` with the two backward-compat cherry-picks **empirically validated on both target images**:

| Image | V1.4 step1 | V1.4 step2 | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| v1 `verl-8.5.0-a3` | **0.991** (exact) | **1.263** (exact) | Matches historical V1.4 baseline |
| v2 drill `verl-8.5.2-a3` | **1.275** | **0.895** (grad_norm 2.07) | Drill report had V2.2=1.434 but no V1.4-on-8.5.2 — today establishes it |

"理论 backward-compat" → "实测 backward-compat" for real. Task #26 (8.5.0) + #27 (8.5.2) both closed.

### Extra wrinkles encountered today

1. **#27 round 2 false positive**: smoke ran without error, exited quickly with `reward_score=0.018` (same as v1 validation) and **no step1/step2 entropy_loss in log**. Cause: smoke script checks for existing `/tmp/z00637938/easyr1_smoke_ckpt/global_step_2/` and **resumes from it**. That directory was from #26 (v1) a few minutes earlier. The drill image actually just did inference on a v1-trained model, not new training. Fix: `rm -rf /tmp/z00637938/easyr1_smoke_ckpt` before round 3. Logged as a gotcha in HANDOVER § 6.2 and in the smoke runbook.
2. **chips 2,3 + drill image inexplicably failed** (0 NPU enumerated) while chips 0,1 worked fine. Root cause not investigated. Current workaround: stick with chips 0,1 for drill smoke until someone finds free time to diagnose.
3. **`run-npu-container.sh --user` flag**: defaults `NPU_USER=$USER`. Under `ssh root@host`, `$USER=root`, so script tries to bind `/home/root`, `/data/root`, `/tmp/root` — none of which exist for the real data owner (`z00637938`). Must pass `--user z00637938` explicitly. Filed as T1-005 for later UX fix.

### Today's commits

- `b3f7a0f` — `run-npu-container.sh` bind fix (critical)
- `eb995b6` — NPU-OPS-009 root cause rewrite + HANDOVER update
- (forthcoming) — UPGRADE-DRILL-STATUS + HANDOVER + adaptation-tasks + this journal update for #27 PASS

### Open

- **T1-004**: skill `image-upgrade-drill` discovery capability — still needs a clean real-upgrade test
- **T1-005**: `run-npu-container.sh` `--user` default UX (defer)
- **#29** scope P2 end-to-end workflow — next focus after #28 commits
- **Drill smoke checkpoint cleanup** — add to runbook/doc as a pre-check step

Catalog: still 24 stable IDs (NPU-OPS-009 rewritten in place, not re-numbered). Skills: 8.
